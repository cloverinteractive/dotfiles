# Tmux

## tmux bindings

For convenience we have changed the following to the `tmux` config:

* To be consistent with `screen` (yeah I'm an old `screen` user) instead of binding the `tmux` prefix to `C-b` we prefix to `C-a`.
* We binded `|` to `split-window -v`, it makes it more obvious you meant vertical split.
* We binded `-` to `split-window -h`, it makes it more obvious you meant horizontal split.
